## About
Pulsar's Produce Pong is our [CSE 312](https://cse312.com/) Web Applications final project. We were required to build a web application with authentication, direct messages, live interactions (websockets), and multimedia uploads. A simple chat app would be sufficient, but we wanted to be more ***EXTREME*** than the minimum requirements.

Produce Pong is similar to regular [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), but the player with the higher score doesn't necessarily win the game. Rather, each round is assigned a random ingredient, and the winner of a round earns that round's ingredient. Once both players are able to create a full recipe with their ingredients, the best recipe possible for each player is determined, and the player with the better recipe wins. The first time a player wins a game by making a particular dish, they'll be awarded an achievement for that dish, which they can view on their profile.

To invite a player to a game, visit the homepage while signed in, click their username on the left to open a chat with them, and then click "Play Pong." This starts a new game and sends the link as a message. Click the link to join the game. The game will begin once both players are ready, which you can signify by pressing `W` or any of the other movement keys. You can move your paddle up and down via `W` + `S` (for gamers), `J` + `K` (for Vim users), or simply the arrow keys. Once the game ends, you'll be redirected to the results page. You can also share the game link with others to spectate the game live.
